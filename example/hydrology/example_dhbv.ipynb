    "\n",
    "In general, differentiable modeling represents the coupling of a neural network and a (differentiable) physical model. This enables several capabilities, like introducing missing processses and bias corrections. In the applications of these notebooks, we demonstrate the parameter learning modality;\n",
    "\n",
    "Physics models include parameters for which True values are seldom known, but can be approximated with various methods. By coupling a neural network (NN), we can learn a set of a physical model's parameters (static or dynamic in, e.g., time), which can then be passed alongside other input variables to the physical model for making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For δHBV 1.0, we use an LSTM NN in concert with the physical model HBV (Beck 2020; Seibert 2005). HBV uses input forcing (time-varying) variables precipitation, temperature, and potential evapotranspiration (PET) across a collection of hydrologic basins, with physical parameters learned at the same spatiotemporal resolution [timesteps, basins], to make predictions about hydrologic states and fluxes (e.g., streamflow in our case) in both space and time. In general, this differentiable model takes the form\n",

    "\n",
    "    Two flexible configuration files exist for augmenting behaviors of the δMG framework: One defines model settings and training/testing parameters, and another defines parameters for your dataset (observations). For this tutorial, two such configuration files have been created and require minimal preparation to use in this notebook:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. [`./generic_deltamodel/example/conf/config_dhbv.yaml`](./../conf/config_dhbv.yaml) -- Model/experiment settings\n",
    "    2. [`./generic_deltamodel/example/conf/observations/camels_531.yaml`](./../conf/observations/camels_531.yaml) and [`camels_671.yaml`](./../conf/observations/camels_671.yaml) -- CAMELS 531- and 671-basin datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "    With these, all aspects of δMG model creation, training, testing, etc. can be controlled. As is, the model/experiment config is setup to reproduce benchmark results for [δHBV 1.0](#publication) (see [here](https://mhpi.github.io/benchmarks/#10-year-training-comparison)) using the CAMELS 531-basin subset of weather forcings and static basin attributes. Full 671-basin benchmark models can also be trained/tested, and both can be configured by setting the following options in the model config:\n",

    "- #### Building a Model \n",
    "\n",
    "    There are two ways to build a differentiable model in δMG which leverage its framework-package duality:\n",
    "    - **Implicit (framework)**: Best for small-scale experiments and distribution of final products.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Add/change modules in δMG to create your own differentiable model, and tailor model and dataset configuration files to reflect desired model and experiment behaviors. (Modules like trainers, physics models, neural networks, loss functions, and data loaders/samplers are designed to be hot-swappable per user needs.)\n",
    "\n",
    "        With these this done, δMG can be run with\n",
    "\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        cd ./generic_deltamodel\n",
    "        python src/dmg/__main__.py\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Explicit (Package)**: Best for exploratory research and prototyping (illustrated in the code block below).\n",
    "\n",
    "        This approach is similar in that we still use config files to handle settings (though a manually-generated dictionary object could also be used). The difference is that we are able to expose the fundamental steps in the modeling process by using δMG like a package; data preprocesing, model building, and experimentation/forwarding can be inported from δMG. In doing so, we make it\n",
    "        quicker to develop model and data pipelines, and easier to follow internal processes without framework-level abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is an explicit implementation of δMG to create and forward δHBV 1.0:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Load a configuration file**: Using Hydra and OmegaConf packages, we can convert the model/dataset configs into a dictionary object `config`. For example, if your config file contains `mode: train`, the dictionary yields `config['mode'] == 'train'`. However, the config can also contain sub-dictionaries. For instance, \n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```yaml\n",
    "    training: \n",
    "        start_time: 1999/10/01\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    which is accessed like `config['training']['start_time'] == '1999/10/01'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Once the config is loaded, we use the function *set_randomseed* to fix randomseeds for NumPy and PyTorch for reproducibility. This is given by the key `random_seed` in the config.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Initialize sub-models**: Next, we initialize the NN and physics model our differentiable model will use, in this case an LSTM from `dmg/models/neural_networks/cudnn_lstm.py` and HBV 1.0 from [hydrodl2](https://github.com/mhpi/hydrodl2).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Load in data**: At this step, we load and process our data as a dictionary of variable and attribute datasets that are used by the NN and physics model. This dataset_dict is created by a data_loader, and should meet minimum requirements of the base class `dmg/core/data/loaders/base.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For this example, we take a small, arbitrarily selected sample of the data to illustrate the modeling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Create a differentiable model**: Now, the sub-models are linked together by a differentiable model wrapper (`DplModel`). This has the effect of interfacing both models to achieve the desired modality, e.g., having the LSTM generate parameters for HBV. \n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Forward/Experiment**: With the differentiable model created, it can be forwarded (as demonstrated\n",
    "    below), or applied in any user-defined experiments.\n",

Each minibatch is randomly sampled with replacement from the training set, with the *n_minibatch* being a sufficient batch size to guarantee full dataset coverage during each epoch.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   For each batch:\n",
    "   - **Sample Data**: `HydroDataSampler` randomly selects a sample of training data for the batch.\n",
    "   - **Forward Pass**: The model processes the input data to produce predictions.\n",
    "   - **Calculate Loss**: `loss_func` compares predictions to observed values to calculate the error for the batch.\n",
    "   - **Backward Pass and Optimization**: \n",
    "     - `loss.backward()` computes gradients to adjust the LSTM's weights.\n",
    "     - `optimizer.step()` updates the LSTM weights.\n",
