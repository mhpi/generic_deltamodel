    "This notebook demonstrates forward simulation with the pre-trained model δHBV 2.0UH developed by [Yalan Song et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2024WR038928). For explanation of model structure, methodologies, [data](https://mhpi.github.io/datasets/CONUS/#results), and performance metrics, please refer to Song's publication [below](#publication). If you find this code is useful in your own work, please include the aforementioned citation.\n",

    "- **Environment**: See [setup.md](./../../docs/setup.md) for ENV setup. dMG must be installed with dependencies + hydrodl2 to run this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model and Data**: The pretrained δHBV 2.0 model weights + input data can be downloaded from [AWS](https://mhpi-spatial.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mhpi-release/models/dhbv_2_trained.zip). (The full δHBV 2.0 40-year, high-resolution simulation product can be downloaded from [sharepoint/dHBV2.0_datasets/](https://pennstateoffice365-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/cxs1024_psu_edu/Eqi1NuJ3d2pMpEJpVu0EGSoBigi-VCWVHgOYIRoTeuGiOw?e=HaNNeA). Be warned it is 101GB in size.) After downloading, update model and data key paths in their respective configs:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. In [`./generic_deltamodel/example/conf/config_dhbv_2.yaml`](./../conf/config_dhbv_2.yaml), update *trained_model* with your path to the parent directory containing both trained model weights `dhbv_2_ep100.pt` **and** normalization file `normalization_statistics.json`.\n",
    "        - **Note**: make sure this path includes the last closing forward slash: e.g., `./your/path/to/model/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. In [`./generic_deltamodel/example/conf/observations/merit.yaml`](./../conf/observations/merit.yaml), update *subbasin_data_path* with your path to `./merit_71_0/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hardware**: The NNs used in this model require CUDA support only available with Nvidia GPUs. For those without access, T4 GPUs can be used when running this notebook with dMG on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n",
