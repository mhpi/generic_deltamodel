    "This notebook demonstrates training and forward simulation with the δHBV 1.1p model developed by [Yalan Song et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.172304428.82707157/v2). A pre-trained model is provided for those who only wish to run the model forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "For explanation of model structure, methodologies, data, and performance metrics, please refer to Song's publication [below](#publication). If you find this code is useful in your own work, please include the aforementioned citation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: If you are new to the δMG framework, we suggest first looking at our [δHBV 1.0 tutorial](./../hydrology/example_dhbv.ipynb).\n",

    "### Before Running:\n",
    "- **Environment**: See [setup.md](./../../docs/setup.md) for ENV setup. δMG must be installed with dependencies + [hydrodl2](https://github.com/mhpi/hydrodl2) to run this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model**: Download pretrained δHBV 1.1p model weights from [AWS](https://mhpi-spatial.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mhpi-release/models/3-dhbv_1_1p.zip). Then update the model config:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In [config_dhbv_1_1p.yaml](./../conf/config_dhbv.yaml), update `model_dir` with the path to your directory containing both trained model weights `hbv_1_1p_ep50.pt` (or *ep100*) **and** `normalization_statistics.json`.\n",
    "    - **Note**: make sure this path includes the last closing forward slash: e.g., `./your/path/to/model/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data**: Download our CAMELS ([details here](https://ral.ucar.edu/solutions/products/camels)) data extraction from [AWS](https://mhpi-spatial.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mhpi-release/data/1-camels.zip). Then, update the data configs:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In [camels_531.yaml](./../conf/observations/camels_531.yaml) and [camels_671.yaml](./../conf/observations/camels_671.yaml), update...\n",
    "        1. `data_path` with path to `camels_daymetv2`,\n",
    "        2. `gage_info` with path to `gage_id.npy`,\n",
    "        3. `subset_path` with path to `531sub_id.txt` (camels_531 only).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The full 671-basin or 531-basin CAMELS datasets can be selected by setting `observations: camels_671` or `camels_531` in the model config, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hardware**: The NNs used in this model require CUDA support only available with Nvidia GPUs. For those without access, T4 GPUs can be used when running this notebook with δMG on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n",
