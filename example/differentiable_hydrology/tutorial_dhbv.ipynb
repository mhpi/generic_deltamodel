    "In this tutorial, we’ll walk through a basic implementation of the generic differentiable modeling framework *DeltaModel*\n",
    "using the hydrology model [HBV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBV_hydrology_model) from *hydroDL2.0* as a physics backbone.\n",
    "The resulting model we call $\\delta$ HBV (citation).\n",
    "    \n",
    "In general, the differentiable model modality presented here is composed of a coupled physics model and neural network.\n",
    "Physics models include parameters for which True values are often unknown, but approximated to varying degrees in practice.\n",
    "By coupling a neural network, we can learn a set of a physics model's parameters, which can then be fed back in\n",
    "alongside other known input variables to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we use the physics model HBV and an LSTM parameterization network as the core of a differentiable model.\n",
    "Since HBV uses input forcing variables precipitation, temperature, and potential evapotranspiration (PET)\n",
    "with dimensions of days $x$ sites, the LSTM will learn parameters at every site for every day. The structure of the\n",
    "differentiable model, therefore, looks like so:\n",

    "\\delta \\text{HBV} = \n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "\\text{Learned Parameters = } \\text{LSTM}(x \\text{, } A) \\\\\n",

    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "- \\( $x$ \\) represents input weather forcings\n",
    "- \\( $A$ \\) is the set of basin attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Currently, $\\delta$ HBV is setup to train and make hydrologic predictions on **streamflow**, but it can\n",
    "also be reconfigured without much effort to predict percolation, recharge, and groundwater flow, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After showing an example implementation, we'll demonstrate how to train the model and expose critical details of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "- **Code**: Before beginning, please see `examples/differentiable hydrology/setup_guide.md`\n",
    "for steps on how to setup DeltaModel, hydroDL2, and the included Conda ENV (`envs/deltamod_env.yaml`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ENV**: For a quick start, we recommend using the `deltamod` ENV, which includes a minimal list of\n",
    "all core DeltaModel dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data**: Preconfigured CAMELS data files can be shared on request, but will eventually be made available through the MHPI\n",
    "data engine `hydro_data_dev` along with expanded instructions on how to access.\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Creating a Model\n",
    "For this example, we demonstrate how to get DeltaModel running with minimal setup using the HBV implementation\n",
    "from hydroDL2. Note, there are two versions of $\\delta$ HBV which can be run here:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **$\\delta$ HBV 1.0**: Uses the standard version of the HBV model (citation).\n",
    "- **$\\delta$ HBV 1.1p**: An enhanced version of the HBV model, incorporating modifications like a capillary rise module to\n",
    "improve prediction performance over 1.0 (citation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Switching between these two versions requires only a simple configuration file change, as outlined below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### **Set Model and Experiment Configurations**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Define your desired model settings and experimental parameters in a YAML configuration file. For this tutorial, two\n",
    "    configuration files have been premade for running both versions of $\\delta$ HBV. Each is configured to\n",
    "    use 531 CAMELS basins with 34 years of data available as inputs. For temporal tests, we have further configured\n",
    "    both files to run a 9-year training phase from 1999-2008 and 10-year test phase from 1989-1999 to reproduce benchmark\n",
    "    results of (citation):\n",
    "    -  **$\\delta$ HBV 1.0**: `example/conf/dhbv_config.yaml`\n",
    "    - **$\\delta$ HBV 1.1p**: `example/conf/dHBV_1_1p_config.yaml` \n",
    "\n",
    "- #### **Building the Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Currently, differentiable models can be built with DeltaModel in two ways of varying flexibility:\n",
    "    - **Implicit**: This method is best for small-scale experiments and distribution of final products.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        Add/change modules in DeltaModel to create your own differentiable model, and add to/change\n",
    "        configuration settings in `deltaModel/conf/config.yaml` to reflect the needs of your product. (Modules including\n",
    "        trainers, physics models, neural networks, loss functions, are designed to be hot-swappable per user needs. The\n",
    "        differentiable model modality will eventually also be made more flexible to meet diverse modeling needs. See\n",
    "        `docs/getting_started_guide` for more info on making the DeltaModel your own.) \n",
    "\n",
    "        With these pieces in place, simply run the model in your terminal using\n",
    "        ```shell\n",
    "        cd ./deltaModel\n",
    "        python __main__.py\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Explicit** (Code block below): This method is best for exploratory research and prototyping.\n",
    "\n",
    "        This approach is similar in that we still use a configuration file to hold model and experiment settings (though\n",
    "        a dictionary object can just as well be used). However, here we can expose the fundamental steps in the\n",
    "        modeling process; data preprocesing, model building, and experimentation/forwarding. In doing so, we make it\n",
    "        quicker to develop model and data pipelines, and easier to follow internal processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Walkthrough\n",
    "The example below represents a simple, explicit implementation of a differentiable model using the HBV backbone:\n",
    "1.  **Load a configuration file**: Using Hydra and OmegaConf packages, we can convert our `..config.yaml` into a dictionary\n",
    "    object `config`. For example, if your config file contains `mode: train`, the dictionary yields\n",
    "    `config['mode'] == 'train'`. However, config can also contain sub-dictionaries. Take\n",
    "    ```yaml\n",
    "    training: \n",
    "        start_time: 1999/10/01\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    for instance. In these cases, accessing the subdict can be done like `config['training']['start_time'] == '1999/10/01'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Load in data**: At this step, we load and process our data as a dictionary of variable and attribute datasets\n",
    "    that are used by the neural network and physics model. In general, this dataset dict is supplied by the user, and should meet\n",
    "    minimum requirements established in `docs/getting_started_guide.md`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For this example, we take a small, arbitrarily selected sample of the data to illustrate the modeling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Initialize sub-models**: Next, we initialize the physics model and neural network our differentiable model\n",
    "    will use, HBV and LSTM in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Create a differentiable model**: Now, the sub-models are linked together by the DeltaModel wrapper. This\n",
    "    wrapper interfaces models using the desired modality, i.e., forwarding the LSTM to generate parameters, which are then fed with\n",
    "    forcing variables back into HBV to generate predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Forward/Experiment**: With the differentiable model created, it can be forwarded (as demonstrated\n",
    "    below), or trained/tested/applied in any user-defined experiments."
